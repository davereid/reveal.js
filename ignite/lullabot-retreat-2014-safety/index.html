    <h1>Palm Springs Safety</h1>

Palm Springs is a desert resort city in Riverside County, California, within the Coachella Valley.

    <h2>Snakes</h2>
    <p><img src="images/snake.jpg" style="width: 800px" /></p>
    <aside class="notes">
Spring is rattlesnake season in the Coachella Valley and across Southern California. Seven species of the venomous snake, which have least one rattle and a triangular-shaped head, can be found in the region.

Rattlesnakes aren’t usually aggressive unless they feel threatened or deliberately provoked, the California Department of Fish an Wildlife says. Rattlesnakes account for more than 800 bites per year, and one or two deaths in California.

The Department of Fish and Wildlife recommends:
• Leave the sandals at home. Always wear hiking boots while walking through wilderness areas where snakes might hide.
• Avoid tall grass, weeds and heavy underbrush where snakes might hide during the day.
• Don’t step or put your hands where you can’t see. Be particularly careful climbing or gathering firewood.
• Rattlesnakes can swim – be careful grabbing “sticks” or “branches” in the water.
• Teach children to respect snakes and leave them alone.

    <h2>Scorpions</h2>
    <p><img src="images/scorpion.jpg" style="height: 600px" /></p>
    <aside class="notes">
gold sand scorpion or dune scorpion

Despite their fearsome appearance their venom isn't especially toxic, unless you happen to be a cricket or even another scorpion.   Females are highly cannabalistic and during the summer mating months males often end up at the wrong end of their stings, claws and jaws.

it's exquisitely adapted for living in shifting sand dunes

    <h2>Spiders</h2>
    <p><img src="images/spider.jpg" /></p>
    <aside class="notes">
 This is a sun spider, also sometimes called a camel spider or wind scorpion, though it's neither a spider nor a scorpion.   It might seem that it has 10 legs, but the front pair are actually pedipalps like those of a spider, though in this case they function more like an insect's antennae.   Sun spiders are not venomous, but those jaws are powered by exceptionally powerful muscles and they can leave a large and painful wound.

    <h2>Dehydration</h2>
    <p><img src="images/dehydration.jpg" style="width: 1000px" /></p>
    <aside class="notes">
  During terminal dehydration, the usual symptoms of dehydration, such as headache and leg cramps, can occur. Dehydration requires patience and determination, since it takes from several days to a few weeks.

  The figures show the "underlying cause of death" in 2,162 recorded cases since 2003 was dehydration or malnutrition. They do not include the death toll in 2013.

    <aside class="notes">
  From 2005-2009, there were an average of 3,533 fatal unintentional drownings (non-boating related) annually in the United States — about ten deaths per day. Nearly 80% of people who die from drowning are male. Children ages 1 to 4 have the highest drowning rates.

  Crunch the numbers for a swimming pool and you get about a one in 100,000 chance of dying in a swimming pool.

  If we were to continue our growth at our current rate, if we had a retreat at a pool in the year 2043, one of us will die.

    <h2>Prickly pear cactus (Opuntia)</h2>
    <p><img src="images/prickly-pear-cactus.jpg" /></p>
    <aside class="notes">
  "armed with two kinds of spines; large, smooth, fixed spines and small, hairlike prickles called glochids, that easily penetrate skin and detach from the plant."

  The spikes on the plant can cause skin or eye irritation.

  All cacti fruit are edible. A few cacti plants have other edible parts but a word of caution here; the correct preparation e.g. leaching and/or cooking are sometimes the only things that make them safe to eat. Many are recognised as having hallucinogenic or narcotic properties and therefore can also be regarded as being poisonous.

    <h2>Cactus Plugging</h2>
    <p><img src="images/cactus-gun.jpg" style="width: 800px" /></p>
    <p><a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=cactus+plugging">http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=cactus+plugging</a></p>
    <aside class="notes">
  Cactus plugging is the practice of vandalizing or destroying a cactus, usually a saguaro, for fun. Typically, the cactus is cut open, drained, then packed with explosives and ignited. In another variation, the vandal simply shoots bullets into the cactus body until portions fall off or the entire cactus falls over.

  In one notorious incident in 1982, one David Grundman (27 years old) was killed while cactus plugging. After he and a friend had successfully destroyed a smaller one, they decided to destroy a saguaro cactus. This went rather badly, as a 4-ft-long arm of the saguaro he was "plugging" fell on him.[1][2] The song "Saguaro" by the Austin Lounge Lizards (co-written by Ann Clardy-Ekstrom and Michael Stevens) poked fun at Grundman's death.

    <h2>Palm Springs Aerial Tramway</h2>
    <p><img src="images/tramway.jpg" style="height: 400px" /></p>
    <aside class="notes">
In 1963, an aerial-tram car became stuck for 13½ hours because of an electrical problem in the control room.

In June 1984, an aerial-tram car was headed down the mountain when a bolt from a shock absorber snapped, causing a 30-pound (14 kg) piece of metal to crash through a Plexiglas window along the car's roof. Tram passenger Elaine Tseko of Ontario, California, was struck by the piece and died as a result of the injury.

In September 1984, during routine maintenance, an auxiliary cable snapped and wrapped around the main cable tracks. The Desert Sun newspaper reported that if the broken cable hadn't wedged itself under the main track cables, a rescue car with the tram's workmen in it could have plummeted down the mountain into the lower tramway station. "Without the snag," a state investigator said, "those two men wouldn't be with us today."

In October 2003, a steel cable broke and caused a mechanical failure that left more than fifty tramway customers hanging in mid-air and one hundred passengers stranded at the Mountain station for 4-1/2 hours. During the crisis, tramway officials sought a rescue helicopter but could not locate one.[6] The obstruction was finally removed by a tram operator with no training in maintenance, utilizing a borrowed Leatherman utility knife.

    <h2>Retirees</h2>
    <p><img src="images/old-driver.jpg" style="width: 900px" /></p>
    <aside class="notes">
  Palm Springs has an ideal location, affordable, weather, and lifestyle for retirees. In the 2010 census, 26.5% of the population of Palm Springs is 65 or older, compared to the California average of 11.4% and US nationwide average of 14.1%.

  http://www.cdc.gov/motorvehiclesafety/older_adult_drivers/adult-drivers_factsheet.html

  According to a Carnegie Mellon University study, the fatality rate for drivers 85 and over is four times higher than it is for teenagers, who are usually pegged as our most reckless drivers.
