  <aside>
From 2005-2009, there were an average of 3,533 fatal unintentional drownings (non-boating related) annually in the United States — about ten deaths per day. Nearly 80% of people who die from drowning are male. Children ages 1 to 4 have the highest drowning rates.

Crunch the numbers for a swimming pool and you get about a one in 100,000 chance of dying in a swimming pool.

If we were to continue our growth at our current rate, if we had a retreat at a pool in X years, someone will die.

# Dehydration

Terminal dehydration

http://www.sprypub.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Dehydration_Web.jpg

During terminal dehydration, the usual symptoms of dehydration, such as headache and leg cramps, can occur. Dehydration requires patience and determination, since it takes from several days to a few weeks.

The figures show the "underlying cause of death" in 2,162 recorded cases since 2003 was dehydration or malnutrition. They do not include the death toll in 2013.

# Fruit

## Prickly pear cactus (Opuntia)

http://freelargephotos.com/000025_l.jpg

"armed with two kinds of spines; large, smooth, fixed spines and small, hairlike prickles called glochids, that easily penetrate skin and detach from the plant."

The spikes on the plant can cause skin or eye irritation.

All cacti fruit are edible. A few cacti plants have other edible parts but a word of caution here; the correct preparation e.g. leaching and/or cooking are sometimes the only things that make them safe to eat. Many are recognised as having hallucinogenic or narcotic properties and therefore can also be regarded as being poisonous.

# Retireees

According to a Carnegie Mellon University study, the fatality rate for drivers 85 and over is four times higher than it is for teenagers, who are usually pegged as our most reckless drivers.

# Cactus Plugging

https://www.parentmap.com/c/51b0d6be/images/stories/general_2/0511_baby_cactus_reg.jpg

Cactus plugging is the practice of vandalizing or destroying a cactus, usually a saguaro, for fun. Typically, the cactus is cut open, drained, then packed with explosives and ignited. In another variation, the vandal simply shoots bullets into the cactus body until portions fall off or the entire cactus falls over.

In one notorious incident in 1982, one David Grundman (27 years old) was killed while cactus plugging. After he and a friend had successfully destroyed a smaller one, they decided to destroy a saguaro cactus. This went rather badly, as a 4-ft-long arm of the saguaro he was "plugging" fell on him.[1][2] The song "Saguaro" by the Austin Lounge Lizards (co-written by Ann Clardy-Ekstrom and Michael Stevens) poked fun at Grundman's death.
